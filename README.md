# Statistical Thermodynamics

This is one of the Chemistry assessed practicals I completed in the second year of my Natural Sciences undergraduate degree.

The aim of the practical was to investigate the temperature dependence of the partition function, internal energy and heat capacity for both a two-level and a multi-level system.

I made use of live graphs which allow the user to change the scale of the axes and change constants such as degeneracy and characteristic temperature.
